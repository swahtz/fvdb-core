Simple Residual U-Net Architecture for Sparse Voxel Data.

This module implements a U-Net architecture specifically designed for sparse voxel grids
using the fVDB framework. The architecture is a traditional
U-Net design with an encoder-decoder structure, skip connections, and residual blocks.

The network operates on sparse voxel data represented as JaggedTensors and GridBatch
objects, enabling efficient processing of 3D volumetric data with varying sparsity
patterns. The architecture includes:

- Encoder path: Progressive downsampling with channel expansion
- Decoder path: Progressive upsampling with channel reduction
- Skip connections: Feature addition between encoder and decoder
- Residual connections: Within convolutional blocks for improved gradient flow
- Adaptive padding: Handles convolution boundary conditions for sparse grids

Components:
- SimpleUNetBasicBlock: Basic convolution-batchnorm-activation block
- SimpleUNetConvBlock: Multi-layer residual block
- SimpleUNetDown/Up: Resolution changing operations with channel adjustment
- SimpleUNetPad/Unpad: Boundary handling for sparse convolutions
- SimpleUNetDownUp: Recursive encoder-decoder structure
- SimpleUNet: Main network combining all components

The architecture is designed for tasks requiring dense predictions on sparse 3D data,
such as 3D semantic segmentation, shape completion, or volumetric reconstruction.

class SimpleUNet(nn.Module):
    """
    Complete U-Net architecture for sparse voxel data processing.

    Implements a residual U-Net designed specifically for sparse 3D voxel grids.
    The network follows the classic U-Net structure with encoder-decoder paths,
    skip connections, and residual blocks, adapted for efficient processing of
    sparse volumetric data using the FVDB framework.

    The architecture consists of three main stages:
    1. Padding: Prepares input data with appropriate spatial and channel dimensions
    2. Encoder-Decoder: Recursive downsampling and upsampling with skip connections
    3. Unpadding: Produces final output in original grid dimensions

    The network is designed for dense prediction tasks on sparse 3D data, such as
    semantic segmentation, shape completion, or volumetric reconstruction. The
    residual connections improve gradient flow and training stability, while the
    U-Net structure preserves both local and global spatial information.

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of input channels from the original data.
        base_channels (int): Number of base channels used throughout the network.
        out_channels (int): Number of output channels for final predictions.
        channel_growth_rate (int): Factor by which channels grow at each encoder level.
        kernel_size (NumericMaxRank1): Size of convolution kernels used throughout.
                                      Defaults to 3.
        downup_layer_count (int): Number of encoder-decoder levels. Defaults to 4.
        block_layer_count (int): Number of basic blocks per convolutional block.
                                Defaults to 2.
        momentum (float): Momentum parameter for all batch normalization layers.
                         Defaults to 0.1.
