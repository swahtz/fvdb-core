    Redistances ``field`` to satisfy ``|grad phi| = 1`` (TVD-RK Godunov upwind eikonal solve with a
    frozen Peng sign), then optionally de-staircases it with curvature-based smoothing. The grid
    topology is unchanged: the returned field has the same per-voxel ordering as ``field``.

    Args:
        grid (GridBatch): The grid batch defining the sparse topology.
        field (JaggedTensor): Per-voxel signed field values.
        band (int): Narrow-band half-width in voxels. The field is clamped to ``[-band*vx, band*vx]``.
        smooth (int): Number of smoothing passes (``0`` disables smoothing).
        order (int): TVD-RK order, one of ``1`` (Euler), ``2`` (Heun), or ``3`` (Shu-Osher).
        smoothing (SmoothingMode): Which Laplacian flow each smoothing pass applies --
            :attr:`~fvdb.SmoothingMode.MEAN_CURVATURE` (default) or
            :attr:`~fvdb.SmoothingMode.TAUBIN` (volume-preserving). Only used when ``smooth > 0``.
        redistance_iters (int): Number of redistancing sweeps. ``<= 0`` uses the default
            ``max(6, round(2.5*band) + 2)``.

    Returns:
        sdf (JaggedTensor): The re-initialized SDF, same per-voxel ordering as ``field``.

    Note:
        * Only the **sign** of ``field`` is trusted; magnitudes are rebuilt. With ``smooth=0`` the
          input's zero crossing is preserved (to sub-voxel accuracy); smoothing moves the surface to
          its de-staircased position and then re-redistances.
        * The surface is where the field changes sign between *active* voxels; one active voxel of
          each sign across the crossing is sufficient (two or more per side gives the best sub-voxel
          accuracy). A grid whose active values are all one sign has no surface: the result is the
          constant ``-/+band*vx`` and :func:`rebuild_narrow_band_batch` returns an empty band, which
          is correct for e.g. a tile that lies entirely inside an object. The boundary of the active
          region is not itself a surface.
        * Inactive neighbours read as ``+/-band*vx`` with the sign of the adjacent active voxel, so
          both filled solids (interior active) and narrow bands whose interior is inactive are valid
          inputs. Voxels with no data are best left *inactive* rather than given a value.
        * Voxels whose value is exactly ``0`` have a zero frozen sign and are left at ``0`` by the
          redistance (a no-data pass-through relied on by the ray-implicit-intersection op, which
          treats exact ``0`` as a gap). Their signed neighbours, however, see them as an interface and
          are redistanced toward them, and smoothing blends them -- prune such voxels first when you
          can.
        * Each grid must have isotropic voxels (``ValueError`` otherwise); grids in the batch may
          differ from one another. CUDA only; ``float32`` or ``float64``.
