/// Redistances the input field to satisfy |grad phi| = 1 (TVD-RK Godunov upwind eikonal solve with
/// a frozen Peng sign), then optionally de-staircases it with mean-curvature or volume-preserving
/// Taubin Laplacian smoothing. The grid topology is unchanged: the returned JaggedTensor has the
/// same per-voxel ordering as the input.
///
/// @param batchHdl    Grid batch defining the sparse topology.
/// @param field       Per-voxel signed field (a single list of scalar values, numel ==
///                    totalVoxels). Only its sign is trusted; magnitudes are rebuilt. A voxel whose
///                    value is exactly 0 has a zero frozen sign and is left at 0 by the redistance
///                    (no-data pass-through), though its signed neighbours see it as an interface.
///                    Voxels must be isotropic (a ValueError is raised otherwise).
/// @param band        Narrow-band half-width in voxels. The field is clamped to [-band*vx, band*vx]
///                    each sweep. Inactive neighbours act as a Dirichlet boundary whose value
///                    continues the sign of the adjacent active voxel: -band*vx beside a negative
///                    (interior) voxel, +band*vx beside a positive (exterior) one. An IndexGrid has
///                    a single background slot, so this is how a narrow band with an inactive
///                    interior (e.g. the output of retopologize_sdf) is kept solid rather than
///                    hollow.
/// @param redistanceIters  Number of TVD-RK redistancing sweeps. Pass <= 0 to use the default
///                         max(6, round(2.5*band) + 2).
/// @param order       TVD-RK order: 1 (forward Euler), 2 (Heun), or 3 (Shu-Osher).
/// @param smooth      Number of smoothing passes (0 disables smoothing).
/// @param smoothing   Which Laplacian flow each smoothing pass applies (mean-curvature or Taubin).
/// @return A new per-voxel SDF JaggedTensor on the same grid/ordering as @p field.
